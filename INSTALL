                             Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1

     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23

     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28

     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30

     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2

       Versions earlier than this may compile just fine, but may experience
       runtime issues. Specifically, we experienced software crashes on an
       SMP machine running version 2.96 that were resolved by upgrading to
       3.2.

     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Installation Procedure

    1. Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a 'netmrg'
       directory)

       cd /tmp                                                         
       wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz       
       tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz                                          

    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the directory
       made by your tar command and type the following:

       ./configure                                                     
       make                                                            
       make install                                                    

    3. Setup the database

       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least the password
       (netmrgpass below).

     mysqladmin create netmrg                                                    
     mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql                                
     mysql -u root -p                                                            
     > grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpass'; 

    4. You need to modify your apache config in order to make your NetMRG
       installation live (commonly in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).

       The first is to alias /netmrg to the installed web directory (commonly
       /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).

       Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"              

       The easier way (if you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to just Include
       the conf file we've created anywhere in your file (near the bottom is
       fine).

       Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf                              

       You will need to restart your Apache after making config changes.
       Telling it to reload its config should be good enough

       killall -HUP httpd                                              

    5. Configure the Installation

       There are two files you should edit to reflect your database changes
       and any other items that are needed in your installation. These two
       files are /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml and
       /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/include/config.php.

       For most installations, you will at least need to edit netmrg.xml to
       reflect your database username and password. If you would like to
       change things like your company name that are displayed on the
       website, edit the config.php file.

    6. Setup Permissions

       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run, therefore we will
       setup a user for it.

       # useradd netmrg                                                
       # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg                 
       # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd             

    7. Setup crontab

       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either edit
       /etc/crontab, or run 'crontab -e' as root. For 'crontab -e', use an
       entry similar to this:

       */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh                       

    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing things! The
       default login is admin and the default password is nimda. Point your
       web browser at the host you built this on (something similar to
       http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and please change your password!
