                             Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1

     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23

     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28

     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30

     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2

       Versions earlier than this may compile just fine, but may experience
       runtime issues. Specifically, we experienced software crashes on an
       SMP machine running version 2.96 that were resolved by upgrading to
       3.2.

     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                             Installation Procedure

    1. Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a 'netmrg'
       directory)

       cd /tmp                                                         
       wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz       
       tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz                                          

    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the directory
       made by your tar command and type the following:

       ./configure                                                     
       make                                                            
       make install                                                    

    3. Setup the database

       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least the password
       (netmrgpass below).

     mysqladmin create netmrg                                                    
     mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql                                
     mysql -u root -p                                                            
     > grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpass'; 

    4. Modify your apache config (commonly in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf) to
       alias /netmrg to the installed web directory (commonly
       /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles)

       Example:                                                        
       Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"              

    5. Setup Permissions

       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run, therefore we will
       setup a user for it.

       # useradd netmrg                                                
       # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg                 
       # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd             

    6. Setup crontab

       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either edit
       /etc/crontab, or run 'crontab -e' as root. For 'crontab -e', use an
       entry similar to this:

       */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh                       

    7. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing things! The
       default login is admin and the default password is nimda. Point your
       web browser at the host you built this on (something similar to
       http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and please change your password!
