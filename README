Chapter 3. System Structure

   The components of NetMRG.

     * Gatherer
       The Gatherer is a multi-threaded C++ program that interacts with
       the Database and RRDTOOL to gather and store data. The program
       is run by cron, or another scheduling system of your choice, on
       five minute intervals.
     * Web Interface
       The Web Interface consists of several PHP scripts, static HTML
       files and images, as well as CSS for formatting. It interacts
       with the Database for the storage of configuration data and with
       RRDTOOL for the rendering of graphs for presentation.
     * Database
       The Database is a relational database running on MySQL. It is
       utilized by the Web Interface and the Gatherer.
     * RRDTOOL
       RRDTOOL is a graphing system based upon round-robin databases
       (RRDs). It is used for both storing data into the databases and
       creating graphs using the databases.
     * RRDs
       RRDs are the round-robin databases used by RRDTOOL. They are
       individual files that are writable by the Gatherer and readable
       by the Web Interface.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Monitoring and Reporting Concepts

     * Groups
       Groups are organizational containers used in NetMRG. They are
       capable  of  containing  Devices, as well as having a View
       associated with them. As they are strictly organizational, the
       Web Interface is the only component to utilize them. They are
       ignored by the Gatherer.
     * Devices
       Devices can be thought of as any physical device on your network
       that will be monitored. They may also be used organizationally
       to  group Monitors that are not associated directly to any
       physcial host. Devices may have, but are not required to have,
       IP  addresses,  SNMP community strings, and so forth. Data
       gathering  for Devices may be explicitly disabled. Devices
       contain Sub-Devices.
     * Sub-Devices
       Sub-Devices are discrete entities on a Device. Examples of these
       are network interfaces, disk drives, and so forth. Sub-Devices
       may  have parameters or variables associated with them for
       identification purposes. For example, a web server has a network
       interface designated "eth0." In NetMRG, the server would have a
       network interface Sub-Device which would have a variable of
       "ifDescr" set to "eth0." Sub-Devices contain Monitors.
     * Monitors
       Monitors represent discrete monitorable quantities. The Gatherer
       performs the Monitor's Test upon the Monitor's Sub-Device. The
       result is then stored in a RRD. Monitors are also associated
       with Graph Items. If NetMRG is being used to track events, a
       Monitor may also contain Events.
     * Tests
       Tests are data gathering operations associated with Monitors.
       There  are four types of tests: Scripts, SNMP Queries, SQL
       Queries, and Internal tests. Script tests call a script and use
       either its return code or its output as data. SNMP Tests perform
       a SNMP GET operation against a device using a supplied OID. SQL
       Tests perform a MySQL query and use a value from a returned row
       as data. Internal tests are frequently used tests built into the
       Gatherer.  They  typically  start  as Script Tests but are
       integrated for the sake of efficiency.
     * Events
       Events contain a group of Conditions and Responses. If the
       Conditions of an Event are met, the appropriate response is
       performed.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Graphing Concepts

     * Graphs
       Graphs are the abstraction of a single chart generated by NetMRG
       using RRDTOOL. Graphs have properties such as sizes, a title,
       and vertical labels. They also contain a set of Graph Items
       which represent the separate pieces of data graphed.
          + Custom Graphs
            Custom graphs have "absolute" referencing of data to be
            displayed. They are typically used for graphs that are
            applicable in only one instance, such as a stack graph of
            all Internet links on your network.
          + Templated Graphs
            Template Graphs have "relative" references to data. They
            are used for graphs such as CPU load on a server or traffic
            on  a  network interface. They are applicable in many
            instances. The use of templates allows you to create one
            graph for a set of variables on a Sub-Device and then apply
            that same graph to other Sub-Devices for graphs formatted
            identically. This allows considerable savings of time as
            there is no need to create a Custom Graph for each instance
            of a graph.
     * Graph Items
       Graph Items represent data on a graph. They can represent areas,
       lines, and stacks on Graphs. Each Graph Item is linked to a
       Monitor for dynamic data or given a static value. Options for
       Graph Items include type (such as line, area, stack), color,
       value (either static or dynamic based on a Monitor), and legend
       options.

     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1
     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23
     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28
     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30
     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2
       Versions  earlier than this may compile just fine, but may
       experience runtime issues. Specifically, we experienced software
       crashes  on  an SMP machine running version 2.96 that were
       resolved by upgrading to 3.2.
     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Satisfying Requirements

   Specific instructions to satisfy dependencies for certain platforms
   are presented below. They should be used more as suggestions, not
   necessarily step-by-step instructions. You may need to do more than
   what is listed, or much less, depending on the options you selected
   when installing your operating system.

     * Red Hat Linux
          + In order to satisfy the libstdc++ requirement, Redhat 8.0
            or above is required. NetMRG may not be stable on older
            versions of libstdc++.
          + Install the following RPMs from your Red Hat installation
            media:
               o httpd
               o php
               o php-mysql
               o mysql
               o mysql-server
               o mysql-devel
               o libxml2
               o libxml2-devel
               o net-snmp
               o net-snmp-devel
               o net-snmp-utils
          + Installing RRDTOOL
               o Download an RRDTOOL RPM from http://www.freshrpms.net/
               o OR    Download    the    RRDTOOL   source   from
                 http://www.rrdtool.org/ and compile it.
          + Installing precompiled NetMRG RPM
            Download the latest NetMRG RPM and install it as follows:

            rpm -Uvh netmrg-0.10.rpm
            You will still have to perform the following tasks listed
            in the Install Instructions:
               o Setup the Database
               o Configure Apache
               o Configure the Installation
               o Setup Crontab
     * FreeBSD (4.8)
          + Install the following ports:
               o www/apache13
               o rrdtool
               o net-snmp
               o libxml2
               o mod_php4 (specify MySQL support)
               o lang/gcc32
          + Run configure, specifying gcc32:

./configure 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/gcc3/lib' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/gcc3
   /include' 'CXX=g++32'
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Installation Procedure

    1. Untar  to  some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a
       'netmrg' directory)

cd /tmp
wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
   tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz
    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the
       directory made by your tar command and type the following:

./configure
make
   make install

     Note If configure fails to locate the needed libraries they can be
   manually specified. Run ./configure --help for details on the
      necessary options.
    3. Setup the database
       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least the
       password (netmrgpass below).

mysqladmin create netmrg
mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
mysql -u root -p
> grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpa
   ss';
    4. You need to modify your apache config in order to make your
       NetMRG installation live (commonly in
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
       The first is to alias /netmrg to the installed web directory
       (commonly /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).

       Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"
       The easier way (if you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to just
       Include the conf file we've created anywhere in your file (near
       the bottom is fine).

       Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf
       You  will  need to restart your Apache after making config
       changes. Telling it to reload its config should be good enough

       killall -HUP httpd
    5. Configure the Installation
       All of NetMRG's common configuration options are controlled by
       an XML file, normally located at /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml. You
       should edit this file to make any necessary changes before
       continuing with installation.
       For  most  installations,  you  will at least need to edit
       netmrg.xml to reflect your database username and password.
    6. Setup Permissions
       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run, therefore we
       will setup a user for it.

# useradd netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
   # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd
    7. Setup crontab
       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either edit
       /etc/crontab, or run crontab -e as the netmrg user. For 'crontab
       -e', use an entry similar to this:

su netmrg
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh
   exit
       To edit the master crontab, edit /etc/crontab and add a line
       similar to this:

       */5 * * * * netmrg /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh
    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing
       things! The default login is admin and the default password is
       nimda. Point your web browser at the host you built this on
       (something similar to http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and please
       change your password!
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Upgrade Procedure

   After  doing  a  'make install' as described in the chapter on
   Installing NetMRG, the next step is to run the web-based upgrader.
   This is accomplished by logging into NetMRG with administrator
   privileges, and following the prompts. NetMRG's web interface will
   not operate normally until the web-based upgrade is performed, and
   non-administrator users will only receive a message directing them
   to contact their NetMRG administrator.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 10. NetMRG Tutorial

   This brief tutorial will walk you through the major features of
   NetMRG. The tutorial assumes that you have installed the Net-SNMP
   daemon on a system which you want to monitor.

    1. Create a new group.
         a. Click on Groups in the Monitoring menu.
         b. Click on Add.
         c. In the Name textbox, enter a name for your group, such as
            "Home."
         d. In the Comment textbox, enter a description for your group,
            such as "Computers in my house."
         e. In the Parent drop down box, select -Root- as we want this
            device in the root of the device tree. You can create
            nested groups.
         f. Click the Save Changes button to create your new group.
    2. Create a new device.
         a. Click on the name of your new group. You are now looking at
            an (empty) list of devices in your new group.
         b. Click on Add in the Monitored Devices section.
         c. Click on Create a new device.
         d. In the Name textbox, enter a name for your device, such as
            "My Server."
         e. In the IP or Host Name textbox, enter a domain name or IP
            address of your device. Domain names must be resolvable
            from your monitoring host.
         f. In  the SNMP Support dropdown, select the appropriate
            version. If unsure, select SNMPv1.
         g. In  the  SNMP  Read Community textbox, enter the SNMP
            community string for your device.
         h. Click the Save Changes button to create your new device.
    3. Create a new sub-device.
         a. Click on the name of your new device. You are now looking
            at an (empty) list of sub-devices in your new device.
         b. Click on Add.
         c. In  the  Name textbox, enter "System." This will be a
            pseudo-sub-device used for monitoring the device as a
            whole.
         d. In the Type drop down box, ensure that Group is selected.
         e. Click the Save Changes button to create your new "System"
            sub-device.
    4. Add graph templates.
       Since devices running Net-SNMP are common, NetMRG comes with
       several graph templates for commonly used variables.
         a. Click on Template Graphs in the Graphing menu.
         b. Click on the Apply Template To... next to the Linux Box -
            CPU Utilization template graph.
         c. In the Subdevice drop down box, select My Server - System.
         d. Click on the Save Changes button to apply the template.
         e. Repeat this step for any other graph templates you find
            interesting.
    5. View your new graphs.
         a. Click on Device Tree in the Reporting menu.
         b. Click on the name of your group to expand it.
         c. Click on the graph icon beside your device (orange graphs
            mean there are graphs associated with this device, black
            means there are no graphs attached to this device.
         d. You should now see graphs! If you don't, you may need to
            wait for the gatherer to perform another cycle.

   11. External Authentication
   12. Workday Highlighting
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 11. External Authentication

   NetMRG  handles authentication internally by default, checking
   passwords against its own database. It is possible for NetMRG to use
   other  systems  for  username/password authentication. This is
   accomplished by handing off the authentication task to the HTTP
   server.

   Note You must still create accounts in NetMRG for each user when
   using external authentication in order to assign them permissions
      and rights.

   Details on methods of authentication using the Apache web server are
   available here. There are add-on modules for Apache that allow for
   various  authentication  mechanisms, including LDAP and custom
   database authentication systems. Using Apache-based authentication,
   it is possible for an organization to maintain users and passwords
   in one location for a variety of web-based services, only needing to
   set up application-specific permissions in each application.

   To  enable  external  authentication,  edit netmrg.xml and set
   externalAuth to true.
     _________________________________________________________

Chapter 12. Workday Highlighting

   Shading specific time periods on a graph is possible using NetMRG.
   Typically  this  is  used  for highlighting the workday or SLA
   distinctions based on time of day. The following steps will walk you
   through the setup of workday highlighting on a graph.

    1. Add a new Graph Item.
    2. Select Show Advanced.
    3. Leave the title of the item blank if you want it to be omitted
       on the legend, otherwise enter a label such as "Business Hours."
    4. Set the Item Type to Area.
    5. Select a color for the highlighting.
    6. Select Fixed Value in the Monitor drop-down.
    7. Type in "INF" as the fixed value. This allows the graph item to
       take on an infinite height, which is rendered by filling the
       background.
    8. Unselect all checkboxes under Legend.
    9. Enter start and stop times in their respective text boxes. Times
       should be prefixed with a plus sign ('+') and be consistent with
       GNU Date Input Formats. An example would be +9am for a start
       time  and +5pm for an end time, to highlight the "typical"
       business day.
   10. Click Save Changes and observe the colored rectangle cover a lot
       of the data on your graph.
   11. Click Move Up beside your new graph item until it reaches the

          + Name - Name of a device; commonly the hostname
          + IP or Hostname - IP address of the device, or hostname
            (must be resolvable by the monitoring box)
          + Device Type - Type of device (currently not used)
          + Disabled - Don't gather data for this device
     * SNMP
          + SNMP Support - The version of SNMP to use when querying
            this device, if any.
          + SNMP Read Community - The SNMP community string to use when
            querying this device.
          + Recaching  Method  - Methods used by the gatherer for
            determining if its SNMP cache is stale.
               o Never  refresh  cache  - The gatherer will never
                 automatically refresh the cache. The cache must be
                 refreshed manually when changes occur.
               o Refresh on SNMP agent restart - The gatherer will
                 refresh  the cache if the SNMP agent uptime goes
                 backwards, or if the device has become reachable again
                 after a period of unreachability. This option is
                 useful for devices that change interface counts too
                 often, such as a router serving DSL sessions.
               o Refresh on interface count change - The gatherer will
                 refresh the cache if the "ifNumber" value has changed
                 since the last gathering. This typically happens when
                 cards are added to or removed from a router, or when
                 PPP sessions go up or down. (Also includes the above.)
               o Refresh on interface count mismatch - The gatherer
                 will refresh the cache when the number of items in the
                 interface cache do not match the "ifNumber" on a
                 device. This can prevent problems when devices are in
                 the process of booting. This is the preferred option
                 for most devices. (Also includes the above.)
               o Always refresh cache - Always refresh the cache on
                 each gather. This is useful for devices that are
                 always changing, when you care about the changes.
     * Advanced SNMP Options
          + Disable SNMP Uptime Check - Allows NetMRG to work with
            devices  that  are broken or abnormal with respect to
            system.sysUpTime.0. NetMRG usually uses this value to
            determine  if  a host is up and if the SNMP agent has
            restarted since the last polling cycle. It should only be
            used when absolutely necessary as it reduces the robustness
            of the SNMP avoidance and recaching mechanisms which can be
            crutial to performance.
          + SNMP UDP Port - UDP port to direct SNMP queries to (default
            is 161).
          + SNMP Timeout (microseconds) - Number of microseconds to
            wait for a response to a query before retrying (default is
            1000000 or 1 second). An exponential backoff is used after
            each failed query; this is the initial delay.
          + SNMP Retries - Number of times to query the device before
            giving up (default is 3).

Events

Name

   Events -- A container for a collection of actions to take based on
   monitor values

Description

List

   list of events for a monitor

   Note Events displayed in bold are currently triggered.

Edit

   edit info about an event

     * Name - a name for the event, unique within a device. This name
       is used when displaying entries in the Event Log.
     * Trigger  Type  - when to trigger an event. When events are
       triggered, they are logged in the Event Log and any Responses
       associated with the event are executed.
          + On Change - The event is triggered when its conditions are
            met, and the conditions had not been met on the last run.
            Example: If you have an event to warn you when CPU Usage
            climbs above 80%, it will trigger this condition if the
            previous value was 72 and the current value 85, but not if
            the previous value was 82 and the current value 85. This
            prevents duplicate triggerings to a situation spanning
            multiple polling intervals.
          + Never (disabled) - This event is ignored and responses for
            it are not processed.
     * Situation - the severity of the situation the event indicates.
          + Disabled - the tested service is in a non-operational, yet
            normal, condition.
          + Normal - the tested service is operating normally.
          + Warning - the tested service is operating in a degraded
            condition.
          + Critical - the tested service is not operating acceptably.

       Note Situations for an event propagate up the Device Tree. Each
   level takes on the worst situation of its descendents. For example,
   if you have a Critical situation, the Event as well as the Monitor,
   Sub-Device, Device, and Groups above that Event will take on the
      situation Critical as well.

Conditions

Name

   Conditions -- A collection of paramenters to trigger an Event

Description

List

   list of conditions for an event

Edit

   edit info about an condition

     * Logical Operation - the logical operator (AND or OR) to apply
       between this condition and the previous one. This parameter is
       not valid, nor is displayed, for the first condition in a set of
       conditions.
     * Value Type - the type of data about the Monitor to be used for
       comparision.
          + Current Value - the current value of the Monitor
          + Delta Value - the difference between the current value and
            the previous value.
          + Rate of Change - the delta value divided by the difference
            in timestamps between the current and previous values. When
            using counters, this gives you the "per second" value.
     * Condition - the arithmetic operator to use when comparing the
       Value Type of the Monitor and the Value of the Condition.
     * Value - the number used for comparision.
