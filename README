   6. Upgrade Procedure
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1
     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23
     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28
     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30
     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2
       Versions earlier than this may compile just fine, but may
       experience runtime issues. Specifically, we experienced
       software crashes on an SMP machine running version 2.96
       that were resolved by upgrading to 3.2.
     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Satisfying Requirements

   Specific instructions to satisfy dependencies for certain
   platforms are presented below. They should be used more as
   suggestions, not necessarily step-by-step instructions. You may
   need to do more than what is listed, or much less, depending on
   the options you selected when installing your operating system.

     * Red Hat Linux
          + In order to satisfy the libstdc++ requirement, Redhat
            8.0 or above is required. NetMRG may not be stable on
            older versions of libstdc++.
          + Install the following RPMs from your Red Hat
            installation media:
               o httpd
               o php
               o php-mysql
               o mysql
               o mysql-server
               o mysql-devel
               o libxml2
               o libxml2-devel
               o net-snmp
               o net-snmp-devel
               o net-snmp-utils
          + Installing RRDTOOL
               o Download an RRDTOOL RPM from
                 http://www.freshrpms.net/
               o OR Download the RRDTOOL source from
                 http://www.rrdtool.org/ and compile it.
          + Installing precompiled NetMRG RPM
            Download the latest NetMRG RPM and install it as
            follows:
$ rpm -Uvh netmrg-0.10.rpm
            You will still have to perform the following tasks
            listed in the Install Instructions:
               o Setup the Database
               o Configure Apache
               o Configure the Installation
               o Setup Crontab
     * FreeBSD (4.8)
          + Install the following ports:
               o www/apache13
               o rrdtool
               o net-snmp
               o libxml2
               o mod_php4 (specify MySQL support)
               o lang/gcc32
          + Run configure, specifying gcc32:
./configure 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/gcc3/lib' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/gcc3
/include' 'CXX=g++32'
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Installation Procedure

    1. Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a
       'netmrg' directory)
cd /tmp
wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz
    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the
       directory made by your tar command and type the following:
./configure
make
make install

     Note: If configure fails to locate the needed libraries they
     can be manually specified. Run ./configure --help for
     details on the necessary options.
    3. Setup the database
       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least
       the password (netmrgpass below).
mysqladmin create netmrg
mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
mysql -u root -p
> grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpa
ss';
    4. You need to modify your apache config in order to make your
       NetMRG installation live (commonly in
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
       The first is to alias /netmrg to the installed web
       directory (commonly /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).
Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"
       The easier way (if you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to just
       Include the conf file we've created anywhere in your file
       (near the bottom is fine).
Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf
       You will need to restart your Apache after making config
       changes. Telling it to reload its config should be good
       enough
killall -HUP httpd
    5. Configure the Installation
       All of NetMRG's common configuration options are controlled
       by an XML file, normally located at
       /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml. You should edit this file to
       make any necessary changes before continuing with
       installation.
       For most installations, you will at least need to edit
       netmrg.xml to reflect your database username and password.
    6. Setup Permissions
       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run,
       therefore we will setup a user for it.
# useradd netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd
    7. Setup crontab
       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either
       edit /etc/crontab, or run crontab -e as the netmrg user.
       For 'crontab -e', use an entry similar to this:
*/5 * * * * bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]; then
/usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"
       To edit the master crontab, edit /etc/crontab and add a
       line similar to this:
*/5 * * * * netmrg bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]
; then /usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"
    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing
       things! The default login is admin and the default password
       is nimda. Point your web browser at the host you built this
       on (something similar to http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and
       please change your password!
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Upgrade Procedure

   After doing a 'make install' as described in the chapter on
   Installing NetMRG, the next step is to run the web-based
   updater. This is accomplished by logging into NetMRG with
   administrator privileges, and following the prompts. NetMRG's
   web interface will not operate normally and the gatherer will
   not run until the web-based upgrade is performed.
   Non-administrator users will only receive a message directing
   them to contact their NetMRG administrator.

   If you need to perform an upgrade, the updater will prompt you
   to apply all updates. Clicking this link will perform all
   necessary updates for this release.

   If for some reason an update fails, or you would like to
   re-apply an update for any reason, you can goto the updater and
   goto View all available updates. This will present you a list
   of the updates that are available and their status (applied,
   not applied, or error). If you have problems updating from one
   version to the next, you can force individual updates that fail
   so that they're considered 'applied'. Once all updates are
   applied for a particular version, the database will be
   automatically updated to the latest version that has all
   updates applied.

netmrg-gatherer

Name

   netmrg-gatherer -- Gathers data from devices.

Synopsis

   netmrg-gatherer [OPTIONS]

Description

   netmrg-gatherer performs tests on all enabled hosts in NetMRG.
   It will store results in RRD files using RRDTOOL(1) and perform
   actions in response to events.

Global Options

   -h

          Displays usage information and exits.

   -v

          Displays software version and exits.

Operating Options

   -t num threads

          Run no more than the specified number of threads
          simultaneously.

   -X

          Become a daemon.

   -M mode

          Mode of operation. This option controls the manner in
          which the gatherer operates. The modes currently
          supported are "once" (the default, best used manually or
          via cron) which runs all tests once then exits, and
          "wait" (best used when daemonized) which will run all
          tests, wait for the gatherer interval to expire, and
          then repeat.

     Note: To run netmrg-gatherer daemonized, the recommended set
     of options at this point is "-X -S -M wait" which will
     daemonize, repeat the gather cycle on each interval, and
     write output to syslog.

Logging, Debugging and Verbosity Options

   -S

          Syslog. Logs messages to syslog instead of stdout.

   -b

          Bland. Disables color output. By default,
          netmrg-gatherer will display color output when connected
          to a terminal, but will use bland output when its output
          is written to a file. This option should only be needed
          when the detection mechanism has failed, or the user
          doesn't want to see colors when running the program by
          hand.

   -a

          All. Displays all log messages.

   -m

          Most. Displays more messages than default.

   -q

          Quiet. Silences all output.

   -l level mask

          Only outputs messages that match the specified level
          mask.

   -c component mask

          Only outputs messages that match the specified component
          mask.

   -s

          Safe. Tries to keep sensitive information out of the
          displayed messages.

Configuration File Options

   -C config file

          Uses the specified XML configuration file.

   -K config file

          Parses the specified XML configuration file and exits.

Database Options

   -H host

          Uses the specified host name for connecting to the
          database.

   -D database

          Uses the specified database name.

   -u user name

          Uses the specified user name for connecting to the
          database.

   -p [password]

          Uses the specified password for connecting to the
          database. If no password is specified, the user is
          prompted to enter one.

Recaching Options

   -i device id

          Performs an interface recache on the specified device.

   -d device id

          Performs a disk recache on the specified device.

     Note: Recaching options are intended for use by the web
     interface. These options should not be generally used by end
     users.
