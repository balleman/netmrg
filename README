Introduction

   Welcome   to  NetMRG!  NetMRG  is  a  database-driven  network
   monitoring  and  graphing  tool  for  use on Linux systems. It
   offers   an   intuitive  web-based  configuration,  customized
   monitoring   capabilities   for  unusual  situations,  a  fast
   multi-threaded   polling  application,  and  brilliant  graphs
   rendered by RRDTOOL.

   This   document   aims   to  guide  you  swiftly  through  the
   installation  and configuration of NetMRG, as well as act as a
   reference for those with existing installations.

Revision History

     * 0.10pre2
       2003.09.15
       This  release focuses on adding new features and sqaushing
       bugs.  In  addition, there is now an 'updater.php' that is
       required  to be run between versions. A minor change needs
       to   be   made   to  everyone's  'netmrg.xml'  to  add  an
       'externalauth' field inside the 'website' section.

System Structure

   The components of NetMRG.

     * Gatherer
       The   Gatherer   is  a  multi-threaded  C++  program  that
       interacts  with  the  Database  and  RRDTOOL to gather and
       store  data.  The  program  is  run  by  cron,  or another
       scheduling   system   of   your  choice,  on  five  minute
       intervals.
     * Web Interface
       The  Web Interface consists of several PHP scripts, static
       HTML  files  and images, as well as CSS for formatting. It
       interacts   with   the   Database   for   the  storage  of
       configuration  data  and with RRDTOOL for the rendering of
       graphs for presentation.
     * Database
       The Database is a relational database running on MySQL. It
       is utilized by the Web Interface and the Gatherer.
     * RRDTOOL
       RRDTOOL  is  a  graphing  system  based  upon  round-robin
       databases  (RRDs).  It  is used for both storing data into
       the databases and creating graphs using the databases.
     * RRDs
       RRDs  are  the round-robin databases used by RRDTOOL. They
       are individual files that are writable by the Gatherer and
       readable by the Web Interface.
     _________________________________________________________

Monitoring and Reporting Concepts

     * Groups
       Groups  are organizational containers used in NetMRG. They
       are  capable  of  containing  Devices, as well as having a
       View   associated   with   them.   As  they  are  strictly
       organizational, the Web Interface is the only component to
       utilize them. They are ignored by the Gatherer.
     * Devices
       Devices  can  be thought of as any physical device on your
       network  that  will  be  monitored.  They may also be used
       organizationally to group Monitors that are not associated
       directly  to  any physcial host. Devices may have, but are
       not   required  to  have,  IP  addresses,  SNMP  community
       strings,  and  so forth. Data gathering for Devices may be
       explicitly disabled. Devices contain Sub-Devices.
     * Sub-Devices
       Sub-Devices are discrete entities on a Device. Examples of
       these  are  network interfaces, disk drives, and so forth.
       Sub-Devices  may  have  parameters or variables associated
       with  them for identification purposes. For example, a web
       server  has  a  network  interface  designated  "eth0." In
       NetMRG,   the   server  would  have  a  network  interface
       Sub-Device which would have a variable of "ifDescr" set to
       "eth0." Sub-Devices contain Monitors.
     * Monitors
       Monitors  represent  discrete  monitorable quantities. The
       Gatherer  performs  the  Monitor's Test upon the Monitor's
       Sub-Device.  The  result is then stored in a RRD. Monitors
       are  also  associated with Graph Items. If NetMRG is being
       used to track events, a Monitor may also contain Events.
     * Tests
       Tests   are  data  gathering  operations  associated  with
       Monitors.  There  are  four  types of tests: Scripts, SNMP
       Queries,  SQL  Queries,  and  Internal tests. Script tests
       call a script and use either its return code or its output
       as data. SNMP Tests perform a SNMP GET operation against a
       device  using  a  supplied  OID. SQL Tests perform a MySQL
       query  and  use  a  value  from  a  returned  row as data.
       Internal  tests  are  frequently used tests built into the
       Gatherer.  They  typically  start  as Script Tests but are
       integrated for the sake of efficiency.
     * Events
       Events contain a group of Conditions and Responses. If the
       Conditions  of  an Event are met, the appropriate response
       is performed.
     _________________________________________________________

Graphing Concepts

     * Graphs
       Graphs  are the abstraction of a single chart generated by
       NetMRG  using  RRDTOOL.  Graphs  have  properties  such as
       sizes,  a  title, and vertical labels. They also contain a
       set  of Graph Items which represent the separate pieces of
       data graphed.
          + Custom Graphs
            Custom  graphs have "absolute" referencing of data to
            be displayed. They are typically used for graphs that
            are  applicable in only one instance, such as a stack
            graph of all Internet links on your network.
          + Templated Graphs
            Template  Graphs  have "relative" references to data.
            They are used for graphs such as CPU load on a server
            or   traffic   on   a  network  interface.  They  are
            applicable  in  many  instances. The use of templates
            allows you to create one graph for a set of variables
            on  a  Sub-Device  and  then apply that same graph to
            other  Sub-Devices  for graphs formatted identically.
            This  allows considerable savings of time as there is
            no need to create a Custom Graph for each instance of
            a graph.
     * Graph Items
       Graph  Items represent data on a graph. They can represent
       areas,  lines,  and  stacks  on Graphs. Each Graph Item is
       linked  to  a  Monitor  for dynamic data or given a static
       value. Options for Graph Items include type (such as line,
       area, stack), color, value (either static or dynamic based
       on a Monitor), and legend options.
     _________________________________________________________

Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1
     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23
     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28
     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30
     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2
       Versions  earlier than this may compile just fine, but may
       experience  runtime  issues.  Specifically, we experienced
       software  crashes  on  an SMP machine running version 2.96
       that were resolved by upgrading to 3.2.
     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2
     _________________________________________________________

Satisfying Requirements

   Specific  instructions  to  satisfy  dependencies  for certain
   platforms  are  presented  below.  They should be used more as
   suggestions,  not  necessarily  step-by-step instructions. You
   may  need  to  do  more  than  what  is  listed, or much less,
   depending  on  the  options  you selected when installing your
   operating system.

     * Red Had Linux
          + In order to satisfy the libstdc++ requirement, Redhat
            8.0 or above is required. NetMRG may not be stable on
            older versions of libstdc++.
          + Install   the   following  RPMs  from  your  Red  Hat
            installation media:
               o httpd
               o php
               o php-mysql
               o mysql
               o mysql-server
               o mysql-devel
               o libxml2
               o libxml2-devel
               o net-snmp
               o net-snmp-devel
               o net-snmp-utils
          + Installing RRDTOOL
               o Download an RRDTOOL RPM from
                 http://www.freshrpms.net/
               o OR    Download    the    RRDTOOL   source   from
                 http://www.rrdtool.org/ and compile it.
     * FreeBSD (4.8)
          + Install the following ports:
               o www/apache13
               o rrdtool
               o net-snmp
               o libxml2
               o mod_php4 (specify MySQL support)
               o lang/gcc32
          + Run configure, specifying gcc32:

./configure 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/gcc3/lib' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/gcc3
/include' 'CXX=g++32'
     _________________________________________________________

Installation Procedure

    1. Untar  to  some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a
       'netmrg' directory)

cd /tmp
wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz

    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the
       directory made by your tar command and type the following:

./configure
make
make install

   Note

   If configure fails to locate the needed libraries they can be
   manually specified. Run ./configure -hr for details on the
   necessary options.
    3. Setup the database
       Now  we need to setup the database. Please change at least
       the password (netmrgpass below).

mysqladmin create netmrg
mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
mysql -u root -p
> grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpa
ss';

    4. You  need  to  modify  your apache config in order to make
       your     NetMRG    installation    live    (commonly    in
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
       The  first  is  to  alias  /netmrg  to  the  installed web
       directory (commonly /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).

Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"

       The  easier  way  (if  you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to
       just  Include the conf file we've created anywhere in your
       file (near the bottom is fine).

Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf

       You  will  need to restart your Apache after making config
       changes.  Telling  it  to reload its config should be good
       enough

killall -HUP httpd

    5. Configure the Installation
       All   of   NetMRG's   common   configuration  options  are
       controlled   by   an   XML   file,   normally  located  at
       /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml.  You  should  edit this file to
       make   any   necessary   changes  before  continuing  with
       installation.
       For  most  installations,  you  will at least need to edit
       netmrg.xml to reflect your database username and password.
    6. Setup Permissions
       NetMRG   does  not  need  superuser  permissions  to  run,
       therefore we will setup a user for it.

# useradd netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd

    7. Setup crontab
       You  can  setup  the crontab entries in two places: either
       edit  /etc/crontab,  or run crontab -e as the netmrg user.
       For 'crontab -e', use an entry similar to this:

su netmrg
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh
exit

       To  edit  the  master crontab, edit /etc/crontab and add a
       line similar to this:

*/5 * * * * netmrg /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh

    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing
       things!  The  default  login  is  admin  and  the  default
       password  is nimda. Point your web browser at the host you
       built this on (something similar to
       http://yourhost.com/netmrg/)   and   please   change  your
       password!
     _________________________________________________________

Upgrade Procedure

   After  doing  a  'make install' as described in the chapter on
   Installing  NetMRG,  the  next  step  is  to run the web-based
   upgrader.  This  is  accomplished  by logging into NetMRG with
   administrator  privileges, and following the prompts. NetMRG's
   web  interface  will  not operate normally until the web-based
   upgrade  is  performed,  and non-administrator users will only
   receive  a  message  directing  them  to  contact their NetMRG
   administrator.
     _________________________________________________________

NetMRG Tutorial

   This  brief  tutorial will walk you through the major features
   of  NetMRG.  The  tutorial assumes that you have installed the
   Net-SNMP daemon on a system which you want to monitor.

    1. Create a new group.
         a. Click on Groups in the Monitoring menu.
         b. Click on Add.
         c. In  the  Name  textbox,  enter a name for your group,
            such as "Home."
         d. In  the Comment textbox, enter a description for your
            group, such as "Computers in my house."
         e. In the Parent drop down box, select -Root- as we want
            this  device  in the root of the device tree. You can
            create nested groups.
         f. Click  the  Save  Changes  button  to create your new
            group.
    2. Create a new device.
         a. Click  on  the  name  of  your new group. You are now
            looking  at  an  (empty)  list of devices in your new
            group.
         b. Click on Add.
         c. Click on Create a new device.
         d. In  the  Name  textbox, enter a name for your device,
            such as "My Server."
         e. In  the  IP or Host Name textbox, enter a domain name
            or  IP  address  of your device. Domain names must be
            resolvable from your monitoring host.
         f. Ensure  that  the  This  device uses SNMP checkbox is
            checked.
         g. In  the SNMP Read Community textbox, enter the SNMPv1
            community string for your device.
         h. Click  the  Save  Changes  button  to create your new
            device.
    3. Create a new sub-device.
         a. Click  on  the  name  of your new device. You are now
            looking at an (empty) list of sub-devices in your new
            device.
         b. Click on Add.
         c. In  the  Name textbox, enter "System." This will be a
            pseudo-sub-device used for monitoring the device as a
            whole.
         d. In  the  Type  drop  down  box,  ensure that Group is
            selected.
         e. Click  the  Save  Changes  button  to create your new
            "System" sub-device.
    4. Add graph templates.
       Since  devices  running  Net-SNMP are common, NetMRG comes
       with several graph templates for commonly used variables.
         a. Click on Template Graphs in the Graphing menu.
         b. Click  on  the  Apply  Template  To...  next  to  the
            %dev_name% - CPU Utilization template graph.
         c. In  the  Subdevice  drop down box, select My Server -
            System.
         d. Click  on  the  Save  Changes  button  to  apply  the
            template.
         e. Repeat  this  step  for any other graph templates you
            find interesting.
    5. View your new graphs.
         a. Click on Device Tree in the Reporting menu.
         b. Click on the name of your group to expand it.
         c. Click on the graph icon beside your device.
         d. You should now see graphs! If you don't, you may need
            to wait for the gatherer to perform another cycle.
     _________________________________________________________

External Authentication

   NetMRG  handles authentication internally by default, checking
   passwords  against its own database. It is possible for NetMRG
   to  use  other  systems  for username/password authentication.
   This is accomplished by handing off the authentication task to
   the HTTP server.

   Note

   You must still create accounts in NetMRG for each user when
   using external authentication in order to assign them
   permissions and rights.

   Details  on  methods  of  authentication  using the Apache web
   server are available here. There are add-on modules for Apache
   that  allow  for  various authentication mechanisms, including
   LDAP   and   custom  database  authentication  systems.  Using
   Apache-based   authentication,   it   is   possible   for   an
   organization  to  maintain users and passwords in one location
   for  a  variety  of web-based services, only needing to set up
   application-specific permissions in each application.

   To  enable  external  authentication,  edit netmrg.xml and set
   externalAuth to true.
