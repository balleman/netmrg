       This  release focuses on adding new features and sqaushing
       bugs.  In  addition, there is now an 'updater.php' that is
       required  to be run between versions. A minor change needs
       to   be   made   to  everyone's  'netmrg.xml'  to  add  an
       'externalauth' field inside the 'website' section.
