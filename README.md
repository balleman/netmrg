======

NetMRG is a tool for network monitoring, reporting, and graphing. Based on RRDTOOL, the best of open source graphing systems, NetMRG is capable of creating graphs of any parameter of your network.

New development of NetMRG has been mostly abandoned since 2008, but there are at least a few users still out there.  To keep the project available, hosting has been migrated to GitHub as of August 2017.
