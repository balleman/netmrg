This program takes a maillog syslog feed in, and puts some nifty stats back out.
You'll need to make a fifo (`mkfifo /var/log/maillog-pipe.log` - probably 
`chmod 600 /var/log/maillog-pipe.log` also), and send your syslog feed to it; 
with a line similar to this:
--- syslog.conf start ---
mail.*                 |/var/log/maillog-pipe.log
--- syslog.conf stop  ---

It's very useful to put this into your inittab, with a line similar to this:
--- inittab start ---
# maillog stats
ml:3:respawn:/usr/local/bin/maillogfilter/maillogfilter /var/log/maillog-pipe.log
--- inittab stop  ---

make sure you setup your mysql database with the table in maillog.mysql.

If you experience any problems, be sure to demand your money back.
