==== apachestats v0.1 ====
Usage: apachestats [(-i|--input) (<file>|STDIN)]
    [(-h|--hostname) <hostname>] [(-r|--hostnamere) <hostname regex>]

  --input       specify the file to read in or STDIN if input is on
                the command line
                [STDIN]
  --hostname    needed when log is a named query log - specifies the host to
                log stats for in the database and to use as the 'host' in the
                apache log
  --hostnamere  regex for the hostnames to match


This program is a direct rip from dnsstats.
This program takes an apache log in and puts some nifty stats back out.
The apache log can either be in combined log format or combined log with 
virtualhost.
It's probably easiest to pipe the combined log w/ vhost directly to this 
script from apache so you get logs for all hosts without any post-processing
and without setting it up in each virtualhost.

Make sure you setup your mysql database with the table in apachestats.mysql.

To setup the NetMRG side of things, you'll need to add an SQL test.  The test
I commonly use uses this query (be sure to fill in the rest of the info):

SELECT counter FROM apachestats.apachestats WHERE host like "%apachehost%" AND type like "%parameters%"

Then, I create a sub-device for the device that I want to monitor with a 
parameter named 'apachehost' and the hostname that shows up in your tables.
When you add your monitors to this sub-device, add a parameters field for each 
type of stat you want to monitor; I usually monitor these, but there are many more:
2%
3%
4%
5%
bytes

Next, you'll want to create a template graph out of these using whatever colors, 
etc that you want (see http://demo.netmrg.net/ for an example).

If you experience any problems, be sure to demand your money back.
