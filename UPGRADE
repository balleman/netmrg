                          Chapter 9. Upgrade Procedure

   After doing a 'make install' as described in the chapter on Installing
   NetMRG, the next step is to run the web-based upgrader. This is
   accomplished by logging into NetMRG with administrator privileges, and
   following the prompts. NetMRG's web interface will not operate normally
   until the web-based upgrade is performed, and non-administrator users will
   only receive a message directing them to contact their NetMRG
   administrator.
