Upgrade Procedure

   After  doing  a  'make install' as described in the chapter on
   Installing  NetMRG,  the  next  step  is  to run the web-based
   upgrader.  This  is  accomplished  by logging into NetMRG with
   administrator  privileges, and following the prompts. NetMRG's
   web  interface  will  not operate normally until the web-based
   upgrade  is  performed,  and non-administrator users will only
   receive  a  message  directing  them  to  contact their NetMRG
   administrator.
