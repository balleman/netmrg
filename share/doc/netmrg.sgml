<chapter id="upgrade">
	<title>Upgrade Procedure</title>
	<para>
After doing a 'make install' as described in the chapter on Installing NetMRG, 
the next step is to run the web-based updater.  This is accomplished by logging
into NetMRG with administrator privileges, and following the prompts.  NetMRG's
web interface will not operate normally and the gatherer will not run until 
the web-based upgrade is performed. Non-administrator users will only receive a 
message directing them to contact their NetMRG administrator.
	</para>
	<para>
If you need to perform an upgrade, the updater will prompt you to 
<guilabel>apply all updates</guilabel>.  Clicking this link will perform all 
necessary updates for this release.
	</para>
	<para>
If for some reason an update fails, or you would like to re-apply an update for 
any reason, you can goto the updater and goto <guilabel>View all available updates</guilabel>.
This will present you a list of the updates that are available and their status 
(applied, not applied, or error).  If you have problems updating from one version 
to the next, you can force individual updates that fail so that they're considered 
'applied'.  Once all updates are applied for a particular version, the database 
will be automatically updated to the latest version that has all updates applied.

  <title>GNU General Public License</title>
  <section id="gpl-1">
    <title>Preamble</title>
    <para>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
      free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
      This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
      Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit 
      to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
      by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it 
      to your programs, too.</para>

    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
      programs; and that you know you can do these things.</para>

    <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
      copies of the software, or if you modify it.</para>

    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or 
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You 
      must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you 
      must show them these terms so they know their rights.</para>

    <para>We protect your rights with two steps:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>copyright the software, and</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
	    distribute and/or modify the software.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <para>Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If 
      the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any 
      problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&apos; 
      reputations.</para>

    <para>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be 
      licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.</para>

    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
      follow.</para>

    <title>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</title>
    <section id="gpl-2-0">
      <title>Section 0</title>
      <para>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
	placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms 
	of this General Public License. The <quote>Program</quote>, below, refers to any such 
	program or work, and a 
	<quote>work based on the Program</quote> means either 
	the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a 
	work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
	modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation 
	is included without limitation in the term 
	<quote>modification</quote>.) Each licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.</para>

      <para>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
	this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
	restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
	constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running 
	the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-1">
      <title>Section 1</title>
      <para>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you 
	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
	publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
	keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
	warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
	along with the Program.</para>

      <para>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at 
	your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-2">
      <title>Section 2</title>
      <para>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
	forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
	or work under the terms of 
	<link linkend="gpl-2-1">Section 1</link> above, provided 
	that you also meet all of these conditions:
	<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
	      you changed the files and the date of any change.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or 
	      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
	      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of 
	      this License.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
	      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
	      ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
	      copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying 
	      that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
	      under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
	      License. (Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but does not 
              normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not 
              required to print an   announcement.)</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections 
	of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
	independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, 
	do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when 
	you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
	Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
	permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and 
	every part regardless of who wrote it.</para>

      <para>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights 
	to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
	the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</para>

      <para>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program 
	(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
	does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-3">
      <title>Section 3</title>
      <para>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
	<link linkend="gpl-2-2">Section 2</link> in object code or executable form under the terms of 
	<link linkend="gpl-2-1">Sections 1</link> and 
	<link linkend="gpl-2-2">2</link> above provided that you also do one of the following:
	<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
	      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
	      customarily used for software interchange; or,</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any 
	      third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source 
	      distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, 
	      to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily 
	      used for software interchange; or,</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
	      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
	      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form 
	      with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
	to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
	it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
	compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source 
	code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
	binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
	on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</para>

      <para>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
	designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
	counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to 
	copy the source along with the object code.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-4">
      <title>Section 4</title>
      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided 
	under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
	Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, 
	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
	licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-5">
      <title>Section 5</title>
      <para>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing 
	else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. 
	These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying 
	or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
	of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
	modifying the Program or works based on it.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-6">
      <title>Section 6</title>
      <para>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient 
	automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
	the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
	on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
	compliance by third parties to this License.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="gpl-2-7">
      <title>Section 7</title>
      <para>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other 
	reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, 
	agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you 
	from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
	your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
	you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
	royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or 
	indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
	to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</para>

      <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, 
	the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply 
	in other circumstances.</para>

      <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property 
	right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
	protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public 
	license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
	distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up 
	to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
	system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</para>

      <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the 
	rest of this License.</para>

    <section id="gpl-2-8">
      <title>Section 8</title>
      <para>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents 
	or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
	distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
	incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</para>

	in detail to address new problems or concerns.</para>

      <para>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of 
	this License which applies to it and <quote>any later version</quote>, you have the option of following the terms 
	and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software

    <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</title>
    <para>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</para>

    <para>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
      to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
      convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
      the <quote>copyright</quote> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</para>

    <para>&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;    &lt;name of author&gt;</para>

    <para>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.</para>

    <para>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.</para>

    <para>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</para>

    <para>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</para>

    <para>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
      when it starts in an interactive mode:</para>

    <para>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type <quote>show w</quote>.
      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
      under certain conditions; type <quote>show c</quote> for details.</para>

    <para>The hypothetical commands <quote>show w</quote> and <quote>show c</quote> should 
      show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you 
      use may be called something other than <quote>show w</quote> and <quote>show c</quote>; 
      they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</para>

    <para>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
      school, if any, to sign a <quote>copyright disclaimer</quote> for the program, if
      necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</para>

    <para>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

    <para>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
      proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
      consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
      library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
      Public License instead of this License.</para>
