	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>Welcome to NetMRG!  NetMRG is a database-driven network monitoring and graphing tool for use on Linux systems.  It offers an intuitive web-based configuration, customized monitoring capabilities for unusual situations, a fast multi-threaded polling application, and brilliant graphs rendered by <ulink url="http://www.rrdtool.org/"><Application>RRDTOOL</Application></ulink>.</para>
	<para>This document aims to guide you swiftly through the installation and configuration of NetMRG, as well as act as a reference for those with existing installations.</para>

		<listitem>
			<para>Groups</para>
			<para>
Groups are organizational containers used in NetMRG.  They are capable of 
containing Devices, as well as having a View associated with them.  As they 
are strictly organizational, the Web Interface is the only component to 
utilize them.  They are ignored by the Gatherer.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Devices</para>
			<para>
Devices can be thought of as any physical device on your network that will 
be monitored.  They may also be used organizationally to group Monitors 
that are not associated directly to any physcial host.  Devices may have, 
but are not required to have, IP addresses, SNMP community strings, and so 
forth.  Data gathering for Devices may be explicitly disabled.  Devices 
contain Sub-Devices.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Sub-Devices</para>
			<para>
Sub-Devices are discrete entities on a Device.  Examples of these are network 
interfaces, disk drives, and so forth.  Sub-Devices may have parameters or 
variables associated with them for identification purposes.  For example, a 
web server has a network interface designated "eth0."  In NetMRG, the server 
would have a network interface Sub-Device which would have a variable of 
"ifDescr" set to "eth0."  Sub-Devices contain Monitors.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Monitors</para>
			<para>
Monitors represent discrete monitorable quantities.  The Gatherer performs the 
Monitor's Test upon the Monitor's Sub-Device.  The result is then stored in a 
RRD.  Monitors are also associated with Graph Items.  If NetMRG is being used 
to track events, a Monitor may also contain Events.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Tests</para>
			<para>
Tests are data gathering operations associated with Monitors.  There are four 
types of tests:  Scripts, SNMP Queries, SQL Queries, and Internal tests.  
Script tests call a script and use either its return code or its output as 
data.  SNMP Tests perform a SNMP GET operation against a device using a 
supplied OID.  SQL Tests perform a MySQL query and use a value from a returned 
row as data.  Internal tests are frequently used tests built into the Gatherer.  
They typically start as Script Tests but are integrated for the sake of 
efficiency.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Events</para>
			<para>
Events contain a group of Conditions and Responses.  If the Conditions of an 
Event are met, the appropriate response is performed.

	<title>Graphing Concepts</title>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Graphs</para><para>Graphs are the abstraction of a single chart generated by NetMRG using <ulink url="http://www.rrdtool.org/"><application>RRDTOOL</application></ulink>.  Graphs have properties such as sizes, a title, and vertical labels.  They also contain a set of Graph Items which represent the separate pieces of data graphed.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Custom Graphs</para><para>Custom graphs have "absolute" referencing of data to be displayed.  They are typically used for graphs that are applicable in only one instance, such as a stack graph of all Internet links on your network.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Templated Graphs</para><para>Template Graphs have "relative" references to data.  They are used for graphs such as CPU load on a server or traffic on a network interface.  They are applicable in many instances.  The use of templates allows you to create one graph for a set of variables on a Sub-Device and then apply that same graph to other Sub-Devices for graphs formatted identically.  This allows considerable savings of time as there is no need to create a Custom Graph for each instance of a graph.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Graph Items</para><para>Graph Items represent data on a graph.  They can represent areas, lines, and stacks on Graphs.  Each Graph Item is linked to a Monitor for dynamic data or given a static value.  Options for Graph Items include type (such as line, area, stack), color, value (either static or dynamic based on a Monitor), and legend options.</para></listitem>

	<title>Software Requirements</title>
	<para>NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><ulink url="http://www.php.net/"><application>PHP</application></ulink>, Version >= 4.1</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para><ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/"><application>MySQL</application></ulink>, Version >= 3.23</para></listitem>

	<title>Installation Proceedure</title>
	<orderedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a 'netmrg' directory)</para>
<programlisting>cd /tmp
wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
Now we need to compile and install the source. <command>cd</command> into the directory 
made by your <command>tar</command> command and type the following:
			</para>
<programlisting>./configure
make
make install</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Setup the database</para>
			<para>
Now we need to setup the database.  Please change at least the password 
(<computeroutput>netmrgpass</computeroutput> below).
			</para>
<programlisting>mysqladmin create netmrg
mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
mysql -u root -p
> grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpass';</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
Modify your apache config (commonly in 
<computeroutput>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</computeroutput>) to alias /netmrg 
to the installed web directory (commonly 
<computeroutput>/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles</computeroutput>)
			</para>
<programlisting>Example:
Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Setup Permissions</para>
			<para>
NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run, therefore we will setup a user for it.
			</para>
<programlisting># useradd netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Setup crontab</para>
			<para>
You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either edit /etc/crontab,
or run 'crontab -e' as root. For 'crontab -e', use an entry similar to this:
			</para>
			<programlisting>*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/netmrg_cron.sh</programlisting>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing things!  The default 
login is <userinput>admin</userinput> and the default password is 
<userinput>nimda</userinput>.  Point your web browser at the host you built 
this on (something similar to <computeroutput>http://yourhost.com/netmrg/</computeroutput>) 
and please change your password!
			</para>

<appendix>
	<title>Contact Information</title>
	<para>We have great aspirations for what NetMRG could become, but as with all open-source software, such aspriations can only be achieved with the active participation of the open-source community.  Please do your part and support software that you use by helping to answer support questions on forums and report bugs to developers.  Thanks!</para>
