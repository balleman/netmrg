== silfreed ==
public website
  - add news section
  - link to documentation
    * auto checkout latest documentation - better yet, version the documentation
      and link to the most recent
ability to go 'up' a level when browsing 'Groups' et al
checkboxes on most pages - provide for massive deletes, duplications, etc
make netmrg xhtml compliant
make icons for links on various pages
  - make svg images for most actions
    * edit interfaces

  HRULE capability

== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
fast-fourier transforms for what data 'should look like'
themes/skins for UI and graphs
  - I'd like to see a neon theme ;) - balleman
distributed netmrg
  - have other netmrg installs that can report back to a master install that
    maintains all the rrd files.
  - how to delegate tasks: have the master keep a list of tasks for the slaves,
    and have the slaves get them periodically?  this will require the
    installations to be named
wizards
  - /wizard dir
  - index.php reads in other files to know name, description, etc
  - used for generating/updating special/large devices (catalyst switches, maxtnts)
