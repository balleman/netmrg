fix everything so register_globals can be off
get auth w/ php sessions to work
  - include check for REMOTE_ADDR
  - if you go back to index.php, the session breaks
convert everything to using config.php
  - setup database to connect using these variables
  - add include for config.php in every web page
  - move all other includes into config.php so they're not duplicated
