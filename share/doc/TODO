research bugtraq & alternatives
  - bug tracking
  - todo tracking
research message board/mailing list
  - searchable archives
  - thread view
CSS-ificiation
  - sub-pages need redone (ick)
menu uses a './' in the link.. must.. kill.. dot...
fix everything so register_globals can be off
get auth w/ php sessions to work
  - include check for REMOTE_ADDR
  - set a standard for auth checks

    * what exactly are the different auth levels?
