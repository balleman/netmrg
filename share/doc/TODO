  - SCRIPT*
get auth w/ php sessions to work
  - include check for REMOTE_ADDR
  - set a standard for auth checks
    * think a combination of IsLoggedIn and check_auth(_level) would be good
    * what exactly are the different auth levels?

== balleman ==
graph templates
make events/responses work again
snmp cacher rewrite

== before going public ==
get new netmrg monitoring something (duo)
talk about license (GPL, LGPL, MPL, BSD, MIT?)
find a bug/todo tracking system
find a mailing list/message board

== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - if one graph shown, ability to zoom in on a area (custom min/max)
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
