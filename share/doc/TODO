snmp_cache_view.php:
  "Make Graph" needs overhauled
  need a "Graph All" feature

== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - if one graph shown, ability to zoom in on a area (custom min/max)
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
  - nestable conditions for events
fast-fourier transforms for what data 'should look like'
themes/skins for UI and graphs
  - I'd like to see a neon theme ;)
distributed netmrg
  - have other netmrg installs that can report back to a master install that
    maintains all the rrd files.
  - how to delegate tasks: have the master keep a list of tasks for the slaves,
    and have the slaves get them periodically?  this will require the
    installations to be named
