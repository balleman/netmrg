== Requirements for 1.0 ==
bug#38 - inline docs
bug#55 - Solaris support
bug#56 - MRTG conf importer

== global ==
documentation
  Usage information (description of every page)
page titles should reflect where you're at
  - names of devices, etc
user preferences
  themes
a device's type can affect the list of tests that can be performed on it
when looking at a device's graphs, you should be able to click next to it
  and follow it to the next device (if applicable)


== silfreed ==
make netmrg xhtml compliant
View Graph replacement (dew)
  - title as text
  - comments as text
  - allow links to other items (next subdevice)
  - <A NAME="title"></a>
  - custom link
Web Interface redesign (dew)
  - big navigations along top
  - "device tree" renamed
  - collapsed view
    * have nav at the top w/ items immediately around where you currently are
    * graphs below nav w/ items of where you're currently at
PHP Library Restructure
  - split libraries into more useful items
  - write a 'loadlib' function to load libries instead of ugly 'include_once's everywhere


== balleman ==
  - ability to compile against librrd instead of using a pipe (should be able to compile for either)
  - rrdd support?
  - portability
   - freebsd
   - solaris


== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
fast-fourier transforms for what data 'should look like'
themes/skins for UI and graphs
  - I'd like to see a neon theme ;) - balleman
distributed netmrg
  - have other netmrg installs that can report back to a master install that
    maintains all the rrd files.
  - how to delegate tasks: have the master keep a list of tasks for the slaves,
    and have the slaves get them periodically?  this will require the
    installations to be named
  - new idea (2004.09.01) - derivation of other ideas
    * boss/worker setup
    * [boss] daemon figures out what needs done and puts that into a [jobs] table
    * [worker]s clock into the [timeclock] so the [boss] can give them [jobs]
    * if the [boss] notices that a [worker] forgot to clock out, it clocks
      them out itself
    * [worker]s report their [job_result]s back
    * have the [boss] keep a schedule in a MySQL Heap table.  It can reschedule
      items by just bumping them up in the queue
      [worker]s can then just poll the mysql table for new tasks for it
      If the website allows for certain devices to only be polled by certain 
      [worker]s, then the [boss] can just assign tasks to that [worker]
wizards
  - /wizard dir
  - index.php reads in other files to know name, description, etc
  - used for generating/updating special/large devices (catalyst switches, maxtnts)
