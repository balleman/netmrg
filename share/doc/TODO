== requirements for 0.10pre2 ==
easier && more documented builds in freebsd
bug#0000020: custom polling intervals
bug#0000031: users changing their own passwords (requires foundation for user prefs)
portability issues: bugs# 29 and 32


== global ==
device duplication
documentation
  Usage information (description of every page)
snmp_cache_view.php:
  need a "Graph All" feature
  depends on: checkbox/group actions
page titles should reflect where you're at
view page should reflect status information
  (based on status of monitors of graphs)
user preferences
  themes passwords
a device's type can affect the list of tests that can be performed on it
when looking at a device's graphs, you should be able to click next to it
  and follow it to the next device (if applicable)
ensure proper escaping in all queries


== silfreed ==
public website
  - add news section
ability to go 'up' a level when browsing 'Groups' et al
checkboxes on most pages - provide for massive deletes, duplications, etc
make netmrg xhtml compliant
make icons for links on various pages
  - make svg images for most actions
    * edit interfaces


== balleman ==
  - ability to compile against librrd instead of using a pipe (should be able to compile for either)
  - portability
   - freebsd
   - solaris


== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
fast-fourier transforms for what data 'should look like'
themes/skins for UI and graphs
  - I'd like to see a neon theme ;) - balleman
distributed netmrg
  - have other netmrg installs that can report back to a master install that
    maintains all the rrd files.
  - how to delegate tasks: have the master keep a list of tasks for the slaves,
    and have the slaves get them periodically?  this will require the
    installations to be named
wizards
  - /wizard dir
  - index.php reads in other files to know name, description, etc
  - used for generating/updating special/large devices (catalyst switches, maxtnts)
