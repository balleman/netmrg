get auth w/ php sessions to work
  - redirections for users w/o proper auth levels is broken
  - include check for REMOTE_ADDR in check_auth
  - set a standard for auth checks
    * think a combination of IsLoggedIn and check_auth would be good
    * what exactly are the different auth levels?
      - single view - "?"
      - read all - "read"

== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - if one graph shown, ability to zoom in on a area (custom min/max)
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
