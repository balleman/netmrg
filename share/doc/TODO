device duplication
more detailed INSTALL
more detailed README
Usage information (description of every page)
'makedist' script
snmp_cache_view.php:
  need a "Graph All" feature
  depends on: checkbox/group actions


== before going public ==
website
get new netmrg monitoring something (duo)


== global ==
prevent a group being its own parent (during editing)
page titles should reflect where you're at
view page should reflect status information (based on status of monitors of graphs)
monitors.php:
  add javascript check so you can't enter a minimum < maximum
ability for user to change their own password
a device's type can affect the list of tests that can be performed on it
when looking at a device's graphs, you should be able to click next to it
  and follow it to the next device (if applicable)
ensure proper escaping in all queries
fix auth in select pages (view, enclose_graph)


== silfreed ==
checkboxes on most pages - provide for massive deletes, duplications, etc
ability to go 'up' a level when browsing 'Groups' et al
public website
  - flesh out content
make netmrg xhtml compliant
make icons for links on various pages
  - make svg images for most actions
    * edit interfaces
these pages don't do auth
  - enclose_graph.php get_graph.php view.php


== balleman ==
netmrg.cc
  more comprehensive way of setting debug levels needed

== far-away features ==
customized 'view' page
  - on the main view page, select boxes to pick which graphs you would like to see
    (makes it easier to compare some graphs)
  - ability to move graphs up/down despite their original ordering (session fun)
fast-fourier transforms for what data 'should look like'
themes/skins for UI and graphs
  - I'd like to see a neon theme ;) - balleman
distributed netmrg
  - have other netmrg installs that can report back to a master install that
    maintains all the rrd files.
  - how to delegate tasks: have the master keep a list of tasks for the slaves,
    and have the slaves get them periodically?  this will require the
    installations to be named
wizards
  - /wizard dir
  - index.php reads in other files to know name, description, etc
  - used for generating/updating special/large devices (catalyst switches, maxtnts)
