      "GPL-1">Preamble</a></h1>

      <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away
      your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
      General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
      to share and change free software - to make sure the software
      is free for all its users. This General Public License
      applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software
      and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
      (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
      the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can
      apply it to your programs, too.</p>

      <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to
      freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
      to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies
      of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
      that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
      free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

      <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
      forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
      surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
      responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      software, or if you modify it.</p>

      <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
      whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
      the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
      receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
      these terms so they know their rights.</p>

      <p>We protect your rights with two steps:</p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p>copyright the software, and</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>offer you this license which gives you legal
          permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
          software.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to
      make certain that everyone understands that there is no
      warranty for this free software. If the software is modified
      by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
      that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
      introduced by others will not reflect on the original
      authors' reputations.</p>

      <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by
      software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
      redistributors of a free program will individually obtain
      patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To
      prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
      licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>

      <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
      and modification follow.</p>
