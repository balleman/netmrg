    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Groups</p>

        <p>Groups are organizational containers used in NetMRG.
        They are capable of containing Devices, as well as having a
        View associated with them. As they are strictly
        organizational, the Web Interface is the only component to
        utilize them. They are ignored by the Gatherer.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Devices</p>

        <p>Devices can be thought of as any physical device on your
        network that will be monitored. They may also be used
        organizationally to group Monitors that are not associated
        directly to any physcial host. Devices may have, but are
        not required to have, IP addresses, SNMP community strings,
        and so forth. Data gathering for Devices may be explicitly
        disabled. Devices contain Sub-Devices.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Sub-Devices</p>

        <p>Sub-Devices are discrete entities on a Device. Examples
        of these are network interfaces, disk drives, and so forth.
        Sub-Devices may have parameters or variables associated
        with them for identification purposes. For example, a web
        server has a network interface designated "eth0." In
        NetMRG, the server would have a network interface
        Sub-Device which would have a variable of "ifDescr" set to
        "eth0." Sub-Devices contain Monitors.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Monitors</p>

        <p>Monitors represent discrete monitorable quantities. The
        Gatherer performs the Monitor's Test upon the Monitor's
        Sub-Device. The result is then stored in a RRD. Monitors
        are also associated with Graph Items. If NetMRG is being
        used to track events, a Monitor may also contain
        Events.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Tests</p>

        <p>Tests are data gathering operations associated with
        Monitors. There are four types of tests: Scripts, SNMP
        Queries, SQL Queries, and Internal tests. Script tests call
        a script and use either its return code or its output as
        data. SNMP Tests perform a SNMP GET operation against a
        device using a supplied OID. SQL Tests perform a MySQL
        query and use a value from a returned row as data. Internal
        tests are frequently used tests built into the Gatherer.
        They typically start as Script Tests but are integrated for
        the sake of efficiency.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Events</p>

        <p>Events contain a group of Conditions and Responses. If
        the Conditions of an Event are met, the appropriate
        response is performed.</p>
      </li>
