>Groups</P
><P
>Groups are organizational containers used in NetMRG.  They are capable of 
containing Devices, as well as having a View associated with them.  As they 
are strictly organizational, the Web Interface is the only component to 
utilize them.  They are ignored by the Gatherer.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Devices</P
><P
>Devices can be thought of as any physical device on your network that will 
be monitored.  They may also be used organizationally to group Monitors 
that are not associated directly to any physcial host.  Devices may have, 
but are not required to have, IP addresses, SNMP community strings, and so 
forth.  Data gathering for Devices may be explicitly disabled.  Devices 
contain Sub-Devices.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Sub-Devices</P
><P
>Sub-Devices are discrete entities on a Device.  Examples of these are network 
interfaces, disk drives, and so forth.  Sub-Devices may have parameters or 
variables associated with them for identification purposes.  For example, a 
web server has a network interface designated "eth0."  In NetMRG, the server 
would have a network interface Sub-Device which would have a variable of 
"ifDescr" set to "eth0."  Sub-Devices contain Monitors.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Monitors</P
><P
>Monitors represent discrete monitorable quantities.  The Gatherer performs the 
Monitor's Test upon the Monitor's Sub-Device.  The result is then stored in a 
RRD.  Monitors are also associated with Graph Items.  If NetMRG is being used 
to track events, a Monitor may also contain Events.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Tests</P
><P
>Tests are data gathering operations associated with Monitors.  There are four 
types of tests:  Scripts, SNMP Queries, SQL Queries, and Internal tests.  
Script tests call a script and use either its return code or its output as 
data.  SNMP Tests perform a SNMP GET operation against a device using a 
supplied OID.  SQL Tests perform a MySQL query and use a value from a returned 
row as data.  Internal tests are frequently used tests built into the Gatherer.  
They typically start as Script Tests but are integrated for the sake of 
efficiency.

>Events</P
><P
>Events contain a group of Conditions and Responses.  If the Conditions of an 
Event are met, the appropriate response is performed.
