   6. Upgrade Procedure
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Software Requirements

   NetMRG Requires the following packages for compilation.

     * PHP, Version >= 4.1
     * MySQL, Version >= 3.23
     * RRDTOOL, Version >= 1.0.28
     * Libxml2, Version >= 2.30
     * Libstdc++, Version >= 3.2
       Versions earlier than this may compile just fine, but may
       experience runtime issues. Specifically, we experienced
       software crashes on an SMP machine running version 2.96
       that were resolved by upgrading to 3.2.
     * NET/UCD-SNMP, Version >= 4.2.2
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Satisfying Requirements

   Specific instructions to satisfy dependencies for certain
   platforms are presented below. They should be used more as
   suggestions, not necessarily step-by-step instructions. You may
   need to do more than what is listed, or much less, depending on
   the options you selected when installing your operating system.

     * Red Hat Linux
          + In order to satisfy the libstdc++ requirement, Redhat
            8.0 or above is required. NetMRG may not be stable on
            older versions of libstdc++.
          + Install the following RPMs from your Red Hat
            installation media:
               o httpd
               o php
               o php-mysql
               o mysql
               o mysql-server
               o mysql-devel
               o libxml2
               o libxml2-devel
               o net-snmp
               o net-snmp-devel
               o net-snmp-utils
          + Installing RRDTOOL
               o Download an RRDTOOL RPM from
                 http://www.freshrpms.net/
               o OR Download the RRDTOOL source from
                 http://www.rrdtool.org/ and compile it.
          + Installing precompiled NetMRG RPM
            Download the latest NetMRG RPM and install it as
            follows:
$ rpm -Uvh netmrg-0.10.rpm
            You will still have to perform the following tasks
            listed in the Install Instructions:
               o Setup the Database
               o Configure Apache
               o Configure the Installation
               o Setup Crontab
     * FreeBSD (4.8)
          + Install the following ports:
               o www/apache13
               o rrdtool
               o net-snmp
               o libxml2
               o mod_php4 (specify MySQL support)
               o lang/gcc32
          + Run configure, specifying gcc32:
./configure 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/gcc3/lib' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/gcc3
/include' 'CXX=g++32'
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Installation Procedure

    1. Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a
       'netmrg' directory)
cd /tmp
wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz
    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the
       directory made by your tar command and type the following:
./configure
make
make install

     Note: If configure fails to locate the needed libraries they
     can be manually specified. Run ./configure --help for
     details on the necessary options.
    3. Setup the database
       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least
       the password (netmrgpass below).
mysqladmin create netmrg
mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
mysql -u root -p
> grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpa
ss';
    4. You need to modify your apache config in order to make your
       NetMRG installation live (commonly in
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
       The first is to alias /netmrg to the installed web
       directory (commonly /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).
Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"
       The easier way (if you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to just
       Include the conf file we've created anywhere in your file
       (near the bottom is fine).
Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf
       You will need to restart your Apache after making config
       changes. Telling it to reload its config should be good
       enough
killall -HUP httpd
    5. Configure the Installation
       All of NetMRG's common configuration options are controlled
       by an XML file, normally located at
       /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml. You should edit this file to
       make any necessary changes before continuing with
       installation.
       For most installations, you will at least need to edit
       netmrg.xml to reflect your database username and password.
    6. Setup Permissions
       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run,
       therefore we will setup a user for it.
# useradd netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
# chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd
    7. Setup crontab
       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either
       edit /etc/crontab, or run crontab -e as the netmrg user.
       For 'crontab -e', use an entry similar to this:
*/5 * * * * bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]; then
/usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"
       To edit the master crontab, edit /etc/crontab and add a
       line similar to this:
*/5 * * * * netmrg bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]
; then /usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"
    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing
       things! The default login is admin and the default password
       is nimda. Point your web browser at the host you built this
       on (something similar to http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and
       please change your password!
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Upgrade Procedure

   After doing a 'make install' as described in the chapter on
   Installing NetMRG, the next step is to run the web-based
   updater. This is accomplished by logging into NetMRG with
   administrator privileges, and following the prompts. NetMRG's
   web interface will not operate normally and the gatherer will
   not run until the web-based upgrade is performed.
   Non-administrator users will only receive a message directing
   them to contact their NetMRG administrator.

   If you need to perform an upgrade, the updater will prompt you
   to apply all updates. Clicking this link will perform all
   necessary updates for this release.

   If for some reason an update fails, or you would like to
   re-apply an update for any reason, you can goto the updater and
   goto View all available updates. This will present you a list
   of the updates that are available and their status (applied,
   not applied, or error). If you have problems updating from one
   version to the next, you can force individual updates that fail
   so that they're considered 'applied'. Once all updates are
   applied for a particular version, the database will be
   automatically updated to the latest version that has all
   updates applied.

netmrg-gatherer

Name

   netmrg-gatherer -- Gathers data from devices.

Synopsis

   netmrg-gatherer [OPTIONS]

Description

   netmrg-gatherer performs tests on all enabled hosts in NetMRG.
   It will store results in RRD files using RRDTOOL(1) and perform
   actions in response to events.

Global Options

   -h

          Displays usage information and exits.

   -v

          Displays software version and exits.

Operating Options

   -t num threads

          Run no more than the specified number of threads
          simultaneously.

   -X

          Become a daemon.

   -M mode

          Mode of operation. This option controls the manner in
          which the gatherer operates. The modes currently
          supported are "once" (the default, best used manually or
          via cron) which runs all tests once then exits, and
          "wait" (best used when daemonized) which will run all
          tests, wait for the gatherer interval to expire, and
          then repeat.

     Note: To run netmrg-gatherer daemonized, the recommended set
     of options at this point is "-X -S -M wait" which will
     daemonize, repeat the gather cycle on each interval, and
     write output to syslog.

Logging, Debugging and Verbosity Options

   -S

          Syslog. Logs messages to syslog instead of stdout.

   -b

          Bland. Disables color output. By default,
          netmrg-gatherer will display color output when connected
          to a terminal, but will use bland output when its output
          is written to a file. This option should only be needed
          when the detection mechanism has failed, or the user
          doesn't want to see colors when running the program by
          hand.

   -a

          All. Displays all log messages.

   -m

          Most. Displays more messages than default.

   -q

          Quiet. Silences all output.

   -l level mask

          Only outputs messages that match the specified level
          mask.

   -c component mask

          Only outputs messages that match the specified component
          mask.

   -s

          Safe. Tries to keep sensitive information out of the
          displayed messages.

Configuration File Options

   -C config file

          Uses the specified XML configuration file.

   -K config file

          Parses the specified XML configuration file and exits.

Database Options

   -H host

          Uses the specified host name for connecting to the
          database.

   -D database

          Uses the specified database name.

   -u user name

          Uses the specified user name for connecting to the
          database.

   -p [password]

          Uses the specified password for connecting to the
          database. If no password is specified, the user is
          prompted to enter one.

Recaching Options

   -i device id

          Performs an interface recache on the specified device.

   -d device id

          Performs a disk recache on the specified device.

     Note: Recaching options are intended for use by the web
     interface. These options should not be generally used by end
     users.

Appendix A. GNU General Public License

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
   Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
   and change free software - to make sure the software is free
   for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
   of the Free Software Foundationʼs software and to any other
   program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
   Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
   General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
   programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
   not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
   sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
   software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
   receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
   change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
   and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
   forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
   surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
   responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
   software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
   whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
   the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
   receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
   these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps:

    1. copyright the software, and
    2. offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
       copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each authorʼs protection and ours, we want to make
   certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
   this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
   and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
   have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
   others will not reflect on the original authorsʼ reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
   patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
   free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
   effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have
   made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyoneʼs
   free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.
     __________________________________________________________

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

Section 0

   This License applies to any program or other work which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
   be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
   The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
   "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
   term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
   are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
   The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
   output from the Program is covered only if its contents
   constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
   been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends
   on what the Program does.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 1

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Programʼs
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
   intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
   absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
   Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
   copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
   exchange for a fee.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 2

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
   portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
   copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
   of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
   conditions:

    a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
       notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
       any change.
    b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
       that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
       Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at
       no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
       License.
    c. If the modified program normally reads commands
       interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
       running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,
       to print or display an announcement including an
       appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
       warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
       that users may redistribute the program under these
       conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
       License. (Exception: If the Program itself is interactive
       but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
       based on the Program is not required to print an
       announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
   Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
   separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
   do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
   part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
   distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
   whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
   whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
   contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
   the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
   of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
   Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
   on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
   the other work under the scope of this License.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 3

   You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2 in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one
   of the following:

    a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code, which must be distributed
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
       customarily used for software interchange; or,
    b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
       years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
       your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
       complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
       code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
       above on a medium customarily used for software
       interchange; or,
    c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the
       offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
       alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
       and only if you received the program in object code or
       executable form with such an offer, in accord with
       Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
   complete source code means all the source code for all modules
   it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
   plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
   of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally
   distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
   system on which the executable runs, unless that component
   itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by
   offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
   equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
   counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
   parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
   object code.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 4

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
   rights, from you under this License will not have their
   licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 5

   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
   modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
   actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
   License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program
   (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
   acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
   or works based on it.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 6

   Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
   the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
   from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
   Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
   impose any further restrictions on the recipientsʼ exercise of
   the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
   enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 7

   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
   patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
   patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
   order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
   of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
   this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
   simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
   distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
   you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
   under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
   is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to
   apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
   any patents or other property right claims or to contest
   validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
   of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
   system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
   people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on
   consistent application of that system; it is up to the
   author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
   that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
   believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 8

   If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
   interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
   Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
   distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
   distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 9

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Program specifies a version number of this License which
   applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
   any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
   the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
   you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 10

   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
   the author to ask for permission. For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
   status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
   the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     __________________________________________________________

NO WARRANTY Section 11

   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
   WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
   WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
   COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     __________________________________________________________

Section 12

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
   MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
   LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
   INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
   OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
   BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
   WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     __________________________________________________________

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
   greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
   this is to make it free software which everyone can
   redistribute and change under these terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
   safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
   effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file
   should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
   where the full notice is found.

   <one line to give the programʼs name and a brief idea of what
   it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
   License along with this program; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
   Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
   paper mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
   like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
   "show w". This is free software, and you are welcome to
   redistribute it under certain conditions; type "show c" for
   details.

   The hypothetical commands "show w" and "show c" should show the
   appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
   commands you use may be called something other than "show w"
   and "show c"; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
   items--whatever suits your program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
   or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for
   the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   program "Gnomovision" (which makes passes at compilers) written
   by James Hacker.

   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
   program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
   subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
   linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
   what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
   instead of this License.
