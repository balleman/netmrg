                       Chapter 5. Installation Procedure

    1. Untar to some directory like /tmp/ (it will untar into a 'netmrg'
       directory)

 cd /tmp
 wget http://www.netmrg.net/download/release/netmrg.tar.gz
 tar xzvf netmrg.tar.gz

    2. Now we need to compile and install the source. cd into the directory
       made by your tar command and type the following:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

         Note: If configure fails to locate the needed libraries they can be
         manually specified. Run ./configure --help for details on the
         necessary options.

    3. Setup the database

       Now we need to setup the database. Please change at least the password
       (netmrgpass below).

 mysqladmin create netmrg
 mysql -u root -p netmrg < share/netmrg.mysql
 mysql -u root -p
 > grant all on netmrg.* to netmrguser@localhost identified by 'netmrgpass';

    4. You need to modify your apache config in order to make your NetMRG
       installation live (commonly in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).

       The first is to alias /netmrg to the installed web directory (commonly
       /usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles).

 Alias /netmrg "/usr/local/var/www/netmrg/webfiles"

       The easier way (if you're running Apache >= 1.3) is to just Include
       the conf file we've created anywhere in your file (near the bottom is
       fine).

 Include /usr/local/etc/netmrg.conf

       You will need to restart your Apache after making config changes.
       Telling it to reload its config should be good enough

 killall -HUP httpd

    5. Configure the Installation

       All of NetMRG's common configuration options are controlled by an XML
       file, normally located at /usr/local/etc/netmrg.xml. You should edit
       this file to make any necessary changes before continuing with
       installation.

       For most installations, you will at least need to edit netmrg.xml to
       reflect your database username and password.

    6. Setup Permissions

       NetMRG does not need superuser permissions to run, therefore we will
       setup a user for it.

 # useradd netmrg
 # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/log/netmrg
 # chown netmrg:netmrg /usr/local/var/lib/netmrg/rrd

    7. Setup crontab

       You can setup the crontab entries in two places: either edit
       /etc/crontab, or run crontab -e as the netmrg user. For 'crontab -e',
       use an entry similar to this:

 */5 * * * * bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]; then /usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"

       To edit the master crontab, edit /etc/crontab and add a line similar
       to this:

 */5 * * * * netmrg bash -c "if [ -f /usr/local/var/lock/subsys/netmrg ]; then /usr/local/bin/netmrg-gatherer; fi"

    8. Point your web browser at your install, and start graphing things! The
       default login is admin and the default password is nimda. Point your
       web browser at the host you built this on (something similar to
       http://yourhost.com/netmrg/) and please change your password!
