   After doing a 'make install' as described in the chapter on Installing
   NetMRG, the next step is to run the web-based updater. This is
   accomplished by logging into NetMRG with administrator privileges, and
   following the prompts. NetMRG's web interface will not operate normally
   and the gatherer will not run until the web-based upgrade is performed.
   Non-administrator users will only receive a message directing them to
   contact their NetMRG administrator.

   If you need to perform an upgrade, the updater will prompt you to apply
   all updates. Clicking this link will perform all necessary updates for
   this release.

   If for some reason an update fails, or you would like to re-apply an
   update for any reason, you can goto the updater and goto View all
   available updates. This will present you a list of the updates that are
   available and their status (applied, not applied, or error). If you have
   problems updating from one version to the next, you can force individual
   updates that fail so that they're considered 'applied'. Once all updates
   are applied for a particular version, the database will be automatically
   updated to the latest version that has all updates applied.
