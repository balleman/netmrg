       Major bug fix; fixes a db error when trying to view monitors, a bug
       that would always set the width and height to zero when creating
       graphs, and makes conditions with 'rate of change' work. Many
       documentation upgrades.

       This release focuses on adding new features and sqaushing bugs. In
       addition, there is now an 'updater.php' that is required to be run
       between versions. A minor change needs to be made to everyone's
       'netmrg.xml' to add an 'externalauth' field inside the 'website'
       section.
